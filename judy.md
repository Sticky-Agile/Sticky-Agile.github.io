# Judy Neher

## Who are you? 
Hi!  I’m Judy Neher and I am based in Indiana in the USA.  My husband and I split our time between Indiana and Cape Coral, Florida. 

## What are your credentials? 
My undergraduate degree is in Mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I have a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University.  I have been a Certified Scrum Trainer® (CST®) since 2015, and have been coaching and training agile teams since 2001.  I am a Certified Professional Co-Active Coach (CPCC) and enjoy both team and individual coaching.  I’m also finishing up a Master’s Degree in Interior Design at Ball State University.

## What industries have you worked with? 
I spent the majority of my career working with the US Federal Government, as a mathematician, software developer, software manager, and then beginning around 2001, as an agile coach and trainer.  Since then I have worked with all types of organization both in the public and private sector, including healthcare, education, publishing, finance, entertainment and hospitality.

## What are you most passionate about? 
I’m really passionate about high performing teams.  Not only the environment that supports high performing teams, but the coaching, training, facilitation and mentoring that is required to guide the teams to high performing.  High performing teams are a game changer for employee engagement.

## What is your favorite slogan or mantra? 
> My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.  
> -- <cite>Maya Angelou</cite>

## If you could do anything in the world and time and money was not a problem, what would you do? 
Given my passion for interior design and architecture, I would spend my time using lean and Scrum practices to design hospitals and healthcare clinics with the goals of reducing patient anxiety and increasing effectiveness for healthcare workers.
