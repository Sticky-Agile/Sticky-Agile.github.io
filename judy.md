# Judy Neher
Judy is the founder and president of Celerity Consulting. Judy is a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) and Agile coach, passionately transforming development teams from traditional development practices to Agile practices since 2001. Judy has spent a majority of her career with the Federal Government (hence her keen interest in Agile security!) as a mathematician, computer scientist, and traditional software manager, ultimately embracing Agile practices as an Agile coach, trainer, and leader. The last decade has afforded Judy the amazing opportunity to work with some of the most interesting commercial organizations in the US, inspiring agility across development teams, leadership, and the organization as a whole.

When Judy isnâ€™t sharing her Scrum passion with teams, she is enjoying the company of her large family, including her husband Chris, and their 6 children. As a family, they enjoy boating, running, traveling, and big family dinners.
