# Julie Chickering
I'm Julie Chickering, and I've never been one to do things by the book.

Not that there's anything wrong with the book. Iâ€™ve learned a lot from books. But I've always preferred a path based on my own tangible experience. As a child, this attitude won me the reputation of being rebellious because I "asked too many questions" and liked to do things the "hard way". It wasn't that I liked difficult experiences. I just needed to understand the purpose behind the action, to figure things out for myself, and then build each experience on the one before.

This may be why Agile practices resonated so strongly with me right from the start: an entire way of working rooted in pragmatism and empirical evidence! A way of applying the scientific method to software development! And so began my transition from rebel to Agile Coach. No longer doing things the "hard way", but rather, a more intentional way.

An Agile way. The JC Agile way.
