# Lonnie Weaver-Johnson

## Who are you? 
My name is Lonnie Weaver-Johnson and I am proud to be a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST), through the Scrum Alliance, the original and only non-profit Scrum certification body. 
## What are your credentials? 
After spending 20 years the corporate world coaching and developing people and teams I knew the becoming a trainer and coach allows me to continue my passion.  
## What industries have you worked with? 
I've been able to do this in the Financial, Retail, Banking, Insurance, Health Care, and Gaming industries. I've also volunteered in the public schools, providing team building to sports teams.
## What are you most passionate about? 
I love  helping people develop their skills and I'm a natural leader and communicator, falling into these opportunities since childhood.  My super powers include empathy and positivity - two characteristics which help me conduct lively and meaningful training and coaching sessions.  
## What is your favorite slogan or mantra? 
A favorite quote I have is from Maya Angelou, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." 
## If you could do anything in the world and time and money was not a problem, what would you do? 
If money was no object, I would create an animal sanctuary where mistreated animals could live out the rest of their lives with love and security.
