# Lonnie Weaver-Johnson
Being an Agile trainer and coach allows me to do one of my favorite things – help people learn and grow.

Scrum is a fantastic way to improve projects by increasing visibility, encouraging collaboration, and improving time to market. Scrum has the power to transform project management across every industry and every business. By using Scrum, organizations can discover how to be prepared through planning and better positioned to react quicker and respond more accurately to the inevitable change that comes their way.  None of this is guaranteed, so finding the right partner is important for your journey.

Teaching Scrum around the world since 2006 has taught me to focus on my students, and now, I want to know how I can help you. Engagement through interactive sessions allows you to learn, practice, and even explore what other students have to say.  Involvement in your learning is practical and priceless.

I’ve coached and trained hundreds of teams in organizations that are large and small, global and local, and in a variety of industries. What’s more important than my past is your next steps and how I can help you take them. I’ve been told that my energy and enthusiasm are contagious. I hope you catch it.
